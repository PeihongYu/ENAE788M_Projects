In this assignment, I implemented two versions of state estimation.

## 1. State estimation using IMU information

The estimated state is defined as [pitch, roll]. 

The implemented algorithms are in the "algos_roll_and_pitch" folder, including:

- complementary_filter
- kalman_filter

The references are:

2. Sensor Fusion: [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZd6XDx5VXo), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUW2OdAtzBw), [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQUkiC5o0JI)

The results:

## 2. State estimaton using both IMU and Magnetometer Information

The estimated state is defined as a 4-dim quaternion vector. 

The implemented algorithms are in the "algos_quaternion" folder, including:

* complementary_filter
* kalman_filter
* extended_kalman_filter

## Matlab's estimation function

I also tested Matlab's [estimation functions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/fusion/ug/introduction-on-choosing-inertial-sensor-fusion-filters.html).
